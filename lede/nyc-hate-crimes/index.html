        <p>Anti-Jewish hate crime stood out with a total of 949 complaints, averaging between 48 and 55 reported incidents per quarter. This makes anti-Semitism the largest motivator of hate crimes in New York City since 2020. </p>
            
        <p>Its highest spike recorded 162 cases in the fourth quarter of 2023 — or four times the number of reports in the preceding quarter. </p>

        <p>The surge in anti-Jewish hate crimes may be attributed to escalations in the Israel-Hamas war during the same period. </p>
        
        <p>In October 2023, Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya), a Sunni Islamist militant group in Palestine, launched armed incursions into Israel from Gaza. Israel’s subsequent military retaliation heightened tensions globally and led to tens of thousands of casualties. </p>
        
        <p>As of June 2024, over 38,000 people were reported killed in the conflict. </p>
        
        <p>Of this number, 108 were journalists and at least 224 were humanitarian aid workers. </p>

        <p>Anti-Asian complaints began to surge in early 2021, which also marked the first anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring Covid-19 as a global pandemic. </p>
        
        <p>Reported incidents peaked at 63 in the second quarter. </p>
        
        <p>Within this period, the Covid-19 death toll surpassed 500,000 and more than 100 million vaccine doses were administered in the U.S. </p>
        
        <p>The pandemic’s impacts extended beyond public health crisis, as it also “unleash(ed) a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres <a href="https://x.com/antonioguterres/status/1258613180030431233?s=20" target="_blank">said in 2020</a>. </p>
        
        <p>Asians and those of Asian descent worldwide were subjected to discrimination and physical attacks, in some instances encouraged either directly or indirectly by government officials themselves. </p>

        <p>Since the third quarter of 2021, the number of reported anti-Asian hate crimes began to decline, albeit with fluctuations. </p>
        
        <p>The total number of reported anti-Asian hate crimes reached 273. </p>
        
        <p>Among reported incidents against race and ethnicity, anti-Black complaints ranked second, with 193 in total and a quarterly average of 11. </p>

        <p>Meanwhile, male homosexuals consistently had the most reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity since 2020. </p>
        
        <p>Reported anti-gay hate crimes totaled 248, averaging 14 per quarter, with incidents rising in mid-2021. </p>
        
        <p>This is followed by anti-transgender hate crimes, totaling 50. &bull; </p>
